            Welcome to the Color Wars app.
            To play the Color Wars game, click on the "App" page above or the button below. Color Wars is a simple casual game that contains conquest elements.
            The player must progress through multiple levels in order to beat the game. Each level contains enemies that will attempt to stop the player from 
            reaching the end. The levels contain blocks that represents territory in the game. Both the player and enemies have the ability to shoot projectiles that 
            can change the color of the blocks upon collision. To progress to the next level, players must open a pathway to the enemy by changing the enemy's blocks into their own.
            By hitting an enemy ship with a projectile, the level will be complete and the player can move on. Players have access to multiple abilities that can give them an 
            edge when taking over blocks.
